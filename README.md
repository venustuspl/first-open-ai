Custom Instructions for ChatGPT: Tips & Tricks
Character Limit: Remember, there's a 1,500-character limit for Custom Instructions. If you find that your instructions are getting cut off, try to be more concise without sacrificing clarity.
Role Confusion: If you've set multiple roles but aren't getting the expected output, make sure you're specifying the role in your prompt. For example, use "R=P" for programming-related queries.
Verbosity Levels: If the AI's responses are too verbose or too brief despite setting verbosity levels, double-check that you've included the "V=" tag in your prompt.
Understanding Limitations: ChatGPT is a text-based model and won't understand highly specialized or technical jargon without context. Make sure to provide enough background information in your queries
